This is my first post on my new blog!

I am a California State University San Marcos graduate with a 
Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science. Join me as I embark on the
 recent college-graduate journey at Planing Center in Carlsbad,
CA.

In this space I will be sharing my experiences as the Summer 2019
Front-End intern at Planning Center via weekly entries, along 
with my thoughts and and reflections relating to the workspace. 
Though my time as an intern may be limited, I hope to make the 
most of it and learn as much as possible from the talented team 
at Planning Center.
